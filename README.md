# PhD thesis scripts

Python scripts used in my [PhD thesis](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02315999/document). They contain, among other algorithms, Morwilog and Bidimac.
I have only selected those scripts that were used in the experiments finally published.
More information about the evaluations can be found in the thesis itself (Chapter 7).
