Statistics come from the full dataset but logs come from the aggregated.

Summary by step:
1- Email with attached exploit
We cannot detect it in the network. It happens locally in the computer, as it is signaled by 14_Ahmed

2- Reverse TCP shell
We cannot detect it either. It does not generate an alert. There is no alert with port number 555

3- NMAP scan 1.105 to 2.0
The scan is not in the logs. Impossible.
There are no alerts going from 192.168.1.105 to any of the IP addresses in 192.168.1.0 or 192.168.2.0...

4- Vulnerability exploitation in 2.112
We cannot detect it either

5- Second scan by 2.112
This is an ICMP scan that is easily detected.
We can implement it with counters

6- SQL injection through 2.112
Also detected by SQL alerts

7- Backdoor
I do not know exactly. There are some weird alerts to 5.122...
It is the attacker! 142.167.88.44 once the backdoor has been established

Sequence of logs:
5- Second scan by 2.112
FROM 17675,1497380315.0,192.168.2.112,192.168.5.1,ICMP test detected,
TO 17986,1497380317.0,192.168.2.112,192.168.5.182,ICMP test detected,
All the alerts are next to each others. The scanned IP addresses are of 192.168.5.0\24
It is clear for the scan:
 - Equality of IP source
 - Equality of type
 - Prefix similarity of destination
 - Counters (maybe 10?)

6- SQL injection through 2.112
Here we can find some different alerts (I take only the ones going against 192.168.5.123)

It seems that here the attacker test different types of SQL servers...

This alerts indicate that the attacker is getting the access via xp_cmdshell

7- Backdoor
The connection itself through the 2.112 is not represented.

There is also a SCAN done from the 112 and some other computers
22760,1497405591.0,192.168.2.112,192.168.5.122,ET SCAN Potential SSH Scan,3875,22,
22762,1497405596.0,192.168.4.118,192.168.5.122,ET SCAN Potential SSH Scan,3967,22,
22763,1497405596.0,192.168.3.115,192.168.5.122,ET SCAN Potential SSH Scan,2786,22,

What is clear is that the 2.112 is not involved anymore.
And the access through the backdoor allows the attacker to perform attacks not only to 5.123, but also to 5.122. In fact, this is what she does

I would put in this step all the attacks made by the attacker against 5.123
The attacker 142.167.88.44

So we do not have logs indicating the creation of the backdoor but we do have logs indicating the use of the backdoor.
And that can be coded in an AASG.

Capture of the computer?? I think that the Backdoor is not made against 2.112
Here there is a final attack that has maybe something to do with it... at least the IP 142.167.88.44 is attacking
But the problem is that we do not have this IP address before. I think it is the attacker once she has established the tunnel
